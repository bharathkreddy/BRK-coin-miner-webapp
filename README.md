# BRK COIN MINER
## Example of microservices run on dockerized containers. 

#### This application is a miner application of fictitious coin called BRK coin. The application architecture is 

**ARCHITECTURE**

![architecture](https://github.com/bharathkreddy/docker-coins-webapp/blob/main/dockercoins-diagram.svg?raw=true)


The application consists of below components
1. rng - a random number generator. This is a python scritp with Flask framwork for web access. 
2. hasher - this is a ruby program which takes the random number generated by rng and converts that to a SHA2 hash.
3. redis - is a key value pair inmemory database, this database keeps a track of how many coins the miner has found. It acts like a wallet for our BRK coins.
4. worker - is the brains of the application, this python code works as below
    - Fethes the random number from rng by GET request exposed by Flask framework. 
    - PUT request is sent to the hasher.
    - Value of Hash generated is read and if he hash starts with the integer 0, this is called a BRK coin. 
    - On finding a BRK coin the values in REDIS which acts as the coin wallet are incremented.
5. webui - is a graphical interface to see the entire application in action. This is written in nodejs and shows the live collection of BRK coins.

The entire application is written to be very modular. Follow below steps to run the BRK miner to mine some BRK coins. 

*Setting up the environment variables so creation of docker images & networks can be run in a loop.*
